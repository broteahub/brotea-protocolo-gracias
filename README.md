# ETH-Denver-2025: Brotea Gracias Protocol

## Project Overview

The Brotea Gracias Protocol is a web3/web2 hybrid system designed to manage and incentivize acknowledgments between various entities (individuals, projects, communities) within the Brotea ecosystem. The protocol leverages blockchain technology to record acknowledgments, distribute rewards, and create a transparent, verifiable system of recognition that builds community and reinforces positive interactions.

## Key Features

- **Web3/Web2 Hybrid System**: Seamlessly bridges web3 functionality with web2 user experience
- **Warpcast Integration**: Leverages Warpcast for user authentication and social interaction
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses ElizaOS to detect and process acknowledgments from social posts
- **Blockchain-Based Recording**: Records all acknowledgments on the Flow blockchain for transparency and verification
- **Token-Based Rewards**: Implements a USDC-based reward system for meaningful acknowledgments
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses AI to analyze and rank acknowledgments by sentiment and impact
- **SDK for External Integration**: Provides components for displaying acknowledgments on external sites

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **AI Agent**: ElizaOS
- **Blockchain**: Flow
- **Social Integration**: Warpcast
- **Open Source Components**: Brotea ecosystem components
