# Brotea Gracias Protocol Documentation

## Overview

The Brotea Gracias Protocol is a web3/web2 hybrid system designed to manage and incentivize appreciations between various entities (individuals, projects, communities) within the Brotea ecosystem. The protocol leverages blockchain technology to record appreciations, distribute rewards, and create a transparent, verifiable system of recognition that builds community and reinforces positive interactions.
